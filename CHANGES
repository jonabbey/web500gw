Version 1.5a (never officially released)
 * Another screen to ask for user/password for modify - it's possible to
   bind as a DS-Manager to modify another entry.
 * help functions for modify form (click on attribute names will give
   users some help on attribute)
 * make "Move upwards to" as a menu form (works for Mosaic but doesn't for lynx)
   (#ifdef UP_MENU)
 * use the new HIDDEN input type for the userPassword in Modify form --
   BUT old browsers will see the password! (#ifdef HIDDEN)
 * included Rakesh B. Patel's code for Kerberos based authentication
   and Rutgers specifics (#if defined(KERBEROS5) && defined(RUTGERS)) and
   SEARCH_ON_TOP    - search field before the non-leaf entry link
   Using this SEARCH_ON_TOP define with the UP_ON_BOTTOM define results in a 
   lynx friendly setup without causing any inconvenience to the full-featured 
   client like Mosiac.
 * splitting web500gw.c :
    web500gw.h  - all the defines/includes/declarations and user changable stuff
    web500gw.c  - the main functions
    util.c      - the utility functions like (de)coding etc.
    kerb.c      - RUTGERS kerberos code
 * Daniel Harris <daniel@reubio.apana.org.au>: changes for NetBSD
 * NDEMAGALHAES@worldbank.org: one mod for DEC/OSF1 machines
 * Zeljko.Horvat@uni-konstanz.de: Windows Mosaic expects a file extension
   for images (*.gif) to display inline images ... #ifdef WINHACK  ugly hack!!!
 * lookup the basedn via ldap, so we use the same format (ie spacing) as the dn
   for strcmp
   UP_ON_BOTTOM     - place "Move upwards to" section on buttom of page
   suggested by Mark Prior <mrp@itd.adelaide.edu.au>
 * bug in clean_ufn(): infinite loop when '=' in RDN
 * never show userPassword's (even if not ACL protected)

 * some portability hacks for HP-UX 9 and ULTRIX 4.3
 * read HTTP request from client correct (to \r\n\r\n)
 * after search: added the friendly description on type of matching 
   (Russ Wright <wright@lbl.gov>)

 * changes headlines (DN's) to <H1>

Version 1.3 (not announced...)

 Suggestions/patches of Rakesh B. Patel <rapatel@noc.rutgers.edu> discussed 
 and included:
   * Full sorting of both list and search menus
     Sort string is: friendly objectClass + surname (if one) + DN
   * show the entry if only one match occurs (if defined SHOWSINGLEENTRY)
   * BASEDN: - starting point for http://host:port/
             - allow Modify only below BASEDN
   * include html code at the top/bottom of the body from a file 
     (DEFAULT_TOP_OF_BODY_FILE, DEFAULT_END_OF_BODY_FILE), when list of BASEDN 
     (if defined)
   * Email addresses become "finger links"(if definded MAIL_FINGER)
   * "Move upward to" links on top of list/read pages
   * "Move to" links on read page of non-leaf entry
   * some "RUTGERS" specific code (if defined RUTGERS)
   * list of search results relative to the search location (not only one RDN 
     if there are more)
   * experimental code for "labeledURL" attribute (if defined URL_SUPPORT)

 * some static config of modify form (mod_attr), what entries we will let
   to modify (mod_oc) -> BUT Modify still needs attention!
 * do_modify: first delete old val, then add new value
 * multiline attrs in forms
 * Bug: add a fflush at the end of do_form/do_modify
 * wrong Content-length in images corrected
 * multiple attribute values now on multiple lines (<BR>)
 * Bug: debug output not in if (debug) -> error when under inetd, 
        error when no lastModifiedTime ==> cleaned

Version 1.2a (18.2.94)

 * some cosmetics and cleanup
 * initial Modify stuff, still experimental and optional (if defined MODIFY);
 * nonLeafObjects with "no children" now correctly handled;

 * some #ifdefs to enable/disable features (SHOWALL);
 * added a SUBMIT button to search form (HTML+ and lynx requ. one);
 * HOSTNAME and myhost deleted (not needed anymore)
 * Now understand the HTTP HEAD request;
 * give also Content-Length and Last-Modified, where possible;
 * added a "See all attributes";
 * changed Copyright note (now BSD like);

 Mark Smith <mcs@umich.edu>:
    * not trying so hard to determine what is leaf or non-leaf;
    * changes to use UFNs as much as possible for display purposes;
    * addition of entry count (e.g., "(5 entries)") to entry lists;
    * small changes to the entry display HTML to be more like gopher;
    * addition of more #ifdef UOFM "dn" attributes;
    * enlargement of cmd buffer, log image size;

Version 1.1 (4.2.94):

 * Better handling of en/decoding of URL strings;
 * multiple DN's in attributes now correctly handled, added more
 * DN attributes;
 * added some stuff for modify, still not working, but on the way
