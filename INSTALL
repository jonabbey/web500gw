                      web500gw: Installation
                      ----------------------

0. Make the ldap distribution (OpenLDAP 1.0, UMich version 3.3 or 
ISODE Consortium's release) if you have not already done so.

In the web500gw directory:

  1. Tailor Makefile:
      INSTDIR             The directory name where to install the web500gw
                          binary.
      MANDIR              The directory name where to install the manual.
      WEB500GWDIR         The directory name where to install
                          config/help/message files. Should be a separate
                          directory.
      SUFFIX              What language dependent files should be
                          installed? "" stands for english (default)
                          versions.
      DEFINES             Enable/disable some features:
                           -DMODIFY           enables MODIFY feature --
                                              STILL EXPERIMENTAL!
                           -DSUPPORT_OLD_URLS if you're upgrading from
                                              older version you may wish
                                              this.
                           -DWEB500GW_DEBUG   include debugging code
                                              (enables Flag -d)

      LDAPINCL            Location of the LDAP header files. Leave empty if
                          installed in /usr/include.
      LDAPLIBS            The LDAP libraries libldap and liblber.
      LDAPVERSION,        LDAP version information, see comments in the
      VERSION             Makefile.
      STR_TRANSLATION     If you didn't define T.61 - ISO-8859-1
                          translation in the LDAP package, comment out this
                          line.
      platform specific   Uncomment the definitions for your platform.
      defines

  2. Optional: Tailor web500gw's default values for your site: edit config.h
     All the values could be set the web500gw.conf configuration file, so
     you probably don't need to edit there..

  3. Make and install web500gw:

       make                 - makes web500gw
       make -n install      - check installation
       # make install       - install it (as root, if installing to system dirs)

  4. Configure web500gw - see http://web500gw.sourceforge.net[B/

  5. Start web500gw
     Test modus - will print HTML output to STDOUT and exit:
          web500gw -t /    or
          web500gw -d 1 -t /    to run in debug mode - see Debug options
     As stand-alone server:
          web500gw    or
          web500gw -d 1   to run in debug mode - see Debug options

  6. Try it out! Run a WWW browser and point it to an appropriate URL to
     access web500gw. Some example URL's are given below, with the things
     you should change given in <>'s:

        http://<host.running.web500gw>:8888/
             - List (Menu) on root level
        http://<host.running.web500gw>:8888/c=DE
             - List on c=DE level
        http://<host.running.web500gw>:8888/o=Technische%20Universitaet%20Chemnitz,c=DE
             - Read entry
        http://<host.running.web500gw>:8888/H
             - Help page

     Of course, you would substitute your own organization's DN. Later you
     will probably add a link to web500gw in an HTML file on your WWW
     server.

  7. If it doesn't work: Manual web500gw.8, Trouble-shooting.
