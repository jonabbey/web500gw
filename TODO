                .....This is a To Do list.....

Some wishes/suggestions from me, our users and from you, the net:

* LDAPv3, Unicode
* fields to be select lists in the web500 add and modify forms
* Bind via Basic Authentication 
* Check the MODIFY feature:
	- userPassword goes as clear text over the line ?? 
    - File upload to add picture
+ Binary / RPM distribution
* searchprefs
* web500gw as Apache module - part of PHP?
* Caching ???
* Better vCard handling
* As another suggestion: (although this might be a bit much...)
  in a form where an attribute is a DN (such as Manager) the user
  should not have to type in the DN.  There should be some sort  
  of Browse... button (or something similar) that would let him  
  choose the right DN.


If you have further suggestions, feel free ...
