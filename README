This directory contains the source for a World Wide Web/HTTP 
to LDAP/X.500 gateway (web500gw).


The program uses the LDAP protocol to talk to X.500.  You will need 
to have the LDAP-3.3/OpenLDAP 1.0 libraries on hand to be able to make 
this software.
    OpenLDAP:        http://www.openldap.org/
