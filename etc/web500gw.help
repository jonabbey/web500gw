<H2> WWW/HTTP - X.500/LDAP Gateway HELP</H2>


<STRONG><FONT COLOR="#006600">Web500gw</FONT></STRONG>
is a World Wide Web/HTTP to X.500/LDAP gateway (version 2.1).
This gateway provides access to LDAP based Directories
for WWW clients. Some features of this gateway: 

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Read of Directory entries</STRONG><DD>
    The attributes of an entry will be shown. 
    Some attributes are handled in a special way:
    <UL>
    <LI>Attributes containing a DN (<TT>see Also, roleOccupant</TT>)
       are Hypertext links to this DN.
    <LI>Attributes containg an E-Mail address could be linked with a
       special action (<TT>mailto:</TT>).
    <LI>Of course, attributes containing an URI (<TT>labeledURI</TT>)
       are shown as Hypertext link to this URI.
    <LI>Photos are either displayed as inline images or may be
       downloaded
       via Hypertext links. (JPEG Photos as JPEG or GIF images,
       dependent on your client, G3Fax Photos as GIF images).
    <LI>Audio data can be retrieved via Hypertext link.
    </UL>
    Dependent on the configuration there will be "special actions" for an
    entry as well, e.g. links (e.g. "Show more attributes") or
    search actions (e.g. list children).

<DT><STRONG>Browse</STRONG><DD>
    Entries below a node may be listed as Hypertext links,
    sorted by objectclasses. Special attributes may be shown (e.g.
    <TT>description</TT>) with the entry name (server configurable or
    via URL). A "Move upwards" list or menu allows to go upwards in the
    Directory tree.

<DT><A NAME="search"><STRONG>Search</STRONG></A><DD>
    In most pages you will find an input field to type in a search item
    and buttons to start search or erase input. 
    At the upper levels of the Directory tree (root or country level)
    searches are assumed to be for countries, organizations or localities 
    and are <TT>one-level</TT> in scope.
    At the lower levels of the tree (organization or organizationalunit level) 
    searches are assumed to be for people and are <TT>subtree</TT> in scope.
    This default search strategy is configurable by your web500gw administrator.

<P> User friendly name (UFN) searching is supported, simply type in:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   <TT>Name, Organzation, Country</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> You can specify complex search filters in URL's,
    but there is currently no interactive search form for this.

<DT><STRONG>Modify</STRONG><DD>
    To modify an entry you have to bind to the Directory.
    Currently only Simple Authentication is supported (plain password).
    It is possible to authenticate as a Manager to modify another entry.
    After successful binding you get a form containing the modifyable
    attributes.
